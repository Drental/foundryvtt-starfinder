As a swift action, you can ask the spirit a question; you can ask a question in this way a number of times equal to your key ability score modifier. The spirit attempts to recall knowledge with any of its available skills, then transmits a response to your question via the device at the start of your next turn. Questions asked of a spirit are wasted if they aren&rsquo;t relevant to its field of expertise or aren&rsquo;t achievable with skill checks to recall knowledge.</p>\n<p>[level_1_only]<strong>1st:</strong> When you cast spiritual consultation as a 1st-level spell, the spirit has a bonus of +6 in one skill of your choice.[/level_1_only]<br />[level_2_only]<strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast spiritual consultation as a 2nd-level spell, the spirit has a bonus of +10 in one skill of your choice.[/level_2_only]<br />[level_3_only]<strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast spiritual consultation as a 3rd-level spell, the spirit has a bonus of +14 in one skill of your choice.[/level_3_only]<br />[level_4_only]<strong>4th:</strong> When you cast spiritual consultation as a 4th-level spell, the spirit has a bonus of +17 in two skills of your choice.[/level_4_only]<br />[level_5_only]<strong>5th:</strong> When you cast spiritual consultation as a 5th-level spell, the spirit has a bonus of +20 in two skills of your choice, and the duration of the spell increases to 10 minutes/level.[/level_5_only]<br />[level_6_only]<strong>6th:</strong> When you cast spiritual consultation as a 6th-level spell, the spirit has a bonus of +23 in two skills of your choice, the duration of the spell increases to 10 minutes/level, and the number of questions you can ask the spirit doubles.[/level_6_only]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
