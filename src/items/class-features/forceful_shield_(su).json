As a full action while holding your solar shield, you can make one melee attack with it, dealing damage as if it were a solar weapon (using your solarian level). You can also use it to make an attack of opportunity if a foe provokes one from you before the beginning of your next turn after you used your solar shield in this way. While attuned or fully attuned, you can align your solar shield against the target of your attack as part of the same full action. If you have a <em>solarian weapon crystal</em> inserted in your solar shield, you apply its benefits to these melee attacks. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation.</span></p>"
