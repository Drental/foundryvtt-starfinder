The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round. This revelation also affects constructs. You can maintain this effect as a move action each round, but the target can attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect. Once a creature succeeds at this save or the effect ends, you canâ€™t target that creature with crush again for 24 hours.<br><br>When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to also stun the target for 1 round. Maintaining crush on subsequent rounds extends the staggered effect, but not the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned} effect.</span></p>"
