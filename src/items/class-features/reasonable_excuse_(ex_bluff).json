When caught in a compromising situation that clearly indicates your guilt or would initiate combat, you can attempt an immediate Bluff check before initiative is rolled to lie and absolve yourself, but you must forgo your expertise die on this check. A successful check will stop an outbreak of violence as long as you (and anyone with you) is cooperative with those you are lying to (for example, leaving a restricted area or handing over stolen property you happen to &ldquo;find&rdquo;). You cannot use this ability to escape consequences for violence and other overtly hostile actions.</p>",
