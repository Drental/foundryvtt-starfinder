As a move action, you can move up to your speed along the ground without provoking attacks of opportunity. Each creature you are adjacent to at any point during that movement takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}. The affected creatures don’t need to be standing on solid ground to fall @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}, and any that were in the air (but still adjacent to you) fall to the ground on a failed save. The damage increases by 1d8 for every 3 solarian levels you have beyond 7th. At 17th level, you can move up to twice your speed along the ground with this revelation.</span></p>"
