      "value": "<p>You can create compact devices that inject their user with a biohack booster in response to specific conditions. While spending 10 minutes to create biohacks, you can transform any number of the created biohacks into auto-injectors and implant them in nearby creatures to whom your custom microlab is attuned. Each auto-injector occupies either the recipient&rsquo;s endocrine body system for augmentations or one of their armor&rsquo;s upgrade slots. When implanting the device, you must choose both the autoâ€‘injector&rsquo;s biohack and its triggering condition, such as &ldquo;this ally is attacked&rdquo; or &ldquo;this ally attempts a Fortitude save.&rdquo; When the triggering condition occurs, the auto-injector activates, injecting the booster into the ally without using an action. The injection takes effect before resolving the triggering action, so a granted AC bonus might avert an otherwise successful hit, a saving throw bonus applies to the triggering save, and so on. The biohacker can use a reaction to delay this auto-injector, preventing it from activating when its condition triggers. With 1 minute of work, the biohacker can remove an auto-injector and install it into another ally&rsquo;s armor, or they can change the auto-injector&rsquo;s triggering condition.</p>\n<p>An auto-injector counts against the biohacker&rsquo;s total number of biohacks they can have ready at one time and remains functional for 24 hours or until they create a biohack to replace it.</p>\n<p><strong>This modifies the biohacks class feature and replaces the minor biohacks class feature.</strong></p>",
