A construct creature or an object in a creature&rsquo;s possession can attempt a Will save to negate this effect.<br />If the possessed object is a computer, you can attempt Mysticism checks in place of Computers checks to operate it. If the possessed object is a lock or trap, you can use Mysticism in place of Engineering to disable it. If the possessed object is a vehicle, you can use Mysticism in place of Piloting to operate it. If the possessed object is a construct, it loses its immunity to mind-affecting effects. If the possessed object is a technological item with charges, it turns on. Objects that don&rsquo;t fit into any of the above categories, including mechs and starships, are unaffected by this ability.</p>",
