As a move action, you supercharge one weapon you&rsquo;re wielding or a weapon wielded by an ally within your melee reach. The weapon must have a battery, and that battery must have at least half its charges remaining. The next attack made with that weapon before the end of your next turn gains a bonus to its damage equal to your solarian level plus your Charisma modifier, but the attack expends the battery&rsquo;s remaining charges.<br />If you&rsquo;re attuned or fully attuned, you can cause half or all of the weapon&rsquo;s damage to become fire damage instead of its normal damage type; this doesn&rsquo;t change whether the attack targets EAC or KAC. If the attack already deals two types of damage, the wielder can replace one or both of them with fire damage.</p>"
