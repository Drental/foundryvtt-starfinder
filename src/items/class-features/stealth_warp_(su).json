As a move action, you can grant yourself a +4 bonus to Stealth checks. This lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.<br><br>When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can use this revelation to reduce your sensory output so much that you can attempt a Stealth check even when youâ€™re directly observed and lack cover or a distraction. You are not invisible, simply difficult to see clearly, and if a creature was observing you prior to your Stealth check, it remains aware of your location until you successfully reach cover or concealment. Your stealth warp ends if you make an attack or cause another creature to attempt a saving throw, or at the beginning of your next turn unless you immediately take another move action to use this revelation.</span></p>"
