  "content": "<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p>Darkvision is the ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified in the creature’s description. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise— when a creature has darkvision, invisible objects and creatures are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally (see the <em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em>). The presence of light does not affect darkvision. </p>",
