  "content": "<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with the telepathy special ability can mentally communicate with any other creature within a certain range (specified in the creature’s description, though the range of telepathy is usually 100 feet) that knows a language or also has telepathy. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time.</span></p>\n<h3>Limited Telepathy</h3>\n<p> Limited telepathy functions in the same manner as telepathy, except that both the creature with the limited telepathy special ability and the creature it is communicating with must have a language in common.</p>",
