  "content": "<h2>CRITICAL FUMBLES</h2>\n<p>Players and GMs can use three methods to determine if an attack is a critical fumble, all triggering only if an attack roll is a natural 1 (the d20 comes up \"1\") and the total attack roll does not meet or exceed the target's AC. Because a critical fumble can be deadly, we recommend using the first option.</p>\n<p>• An attack roll that comes up a natural 1 on the die and misses the target's AC is a critical fumble if the attacker is not proficient with the weapon, or is blinded. confused, or affected by a condition that applies a penalty to attack rolls.<br />• An attack roll that comes up a natural 1 on the die and misses the target's AC is a critical fumble if the attacker takes any penalties to the attack roll.<br />• An attack roll that comes up a natural 1 on the die and misses the target's AC is a critical fumble.</p>\n<h3>USING THE CRITICAL FUMBLE DECK</h3>\n<p>Whenever a character's attack roll is a critical fumble, the player or GM controlling the character draws one card from the deck and follows the result appropriate to that attack's type (energy, kinetic, or spell). If the Extreme Blow! effect matches the damage type (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire. piercing, slashing, or sonic), attack type' (melee or ranged), or weapon category (grenades), that effect must be used instead, </p>\n<h3>ADDITIONAL RULES</h3>\n<p>• A critical fumble misses the target unless noted otherwise.<br />• if a critical fumble says you tike weapon damage, this is the base damage for the attack (even if it is an attack made without a weapon), and does not include bonuses for Weapon Specialization, ability modifiers, class features, or similar modifiers.<br />• Required ability checks have a DC of 10 + 1/2 the attack's level (item level for weapon attacks, or, if the attack wasn't made with a weapon, the' attacker's level or CR); skill checks have a DC of 15 + 1-1/2 the level of the attack.<br />• Any effect that requires an Engineering check to fix a weapon uses Mysticism if the weapon is a magic item; or Medicine if the attack was made without a weapon.<br />• Effects that scale by level use a weapon's item level, a spell's caster level, or a character's level or CR for all other effects. Round fractions up.<br />• An effect based on a spell uses the attacker's character level or CR for any calculaffon not defined an the card.<br />• The save DC for an effect triggered by a PC is equal to 10+ 1/2 the level of the attack (see above) + the PC's key ability score. For an NPC, the save DC is based on the ability DC of the appropriate array and CR (Alien Archive 129-131).<br />• An effect that uses the name of an existing critical hit effect (Starfinder Core Rulebook 182) follows the rules for that critical hit effect.<br />• An effect that lasts \"until healed\" ends once the recipient receives healing equal to the damage dealt by the attack. •<br />If a critical fumble says to reroll the attack, use the same attack bonus as the fumbled attack, and deal full damage if the new attack hits the target. </p>\n<p> </p>",
