A swarm takes normal damage from an attack or effect that affects multiple targets (including lines and fully automatic mode attacks). For the purpose of automatic fire, the swarm counts as five targets. For example, if an automatic attack is made using 12 rounds of ammunition, it can attack a maximum of six targets, so it can damage a swarm normally. However, if two other targets are closer to the attacker than the swarm, they must be attacked first, leaving only four attacks to target the swarm, so it takes no damage.</p>\n<p><em>Format</em>: <strong>Defensive Abilities</strong> swarm defenses.<span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListRulesAll_ctl57_LabelName\"></span></p>",
