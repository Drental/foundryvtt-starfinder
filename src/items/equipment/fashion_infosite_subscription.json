Each subscription is associated with a specific organization or subculture, such as the Stewards, Pact Worlds dance clubs, or Veskarium corporate culture. The subscription takes form of physical chip you can add to a tier-0 or higher computer (such as a comm unit). As long as you check it briefly each day, you gain a +4 bonus to Culture checks made to recall knowledge related to the associated group&rsquo;s apparel and fashion.</p>",
