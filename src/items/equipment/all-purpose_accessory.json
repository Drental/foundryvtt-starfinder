      "value": "<p>With a press of a button, this stylish accessory transforms into a variety of useful items. All-purpose accessories come in multiple designs, including cufflinks, tie pins, barrettes, and jewelry. When you activate your all-purpose accessory as a move action, it instantly reconfigures into your choice of the following items: a @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.LfYPseAOCIBmSFlD]{grappler}, a tool kit that grants a +4 bonus to Engineering checks made to disable locks and mechanical traps, or a @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.21udB0pEmkZhe9gk]{survival knife}. Reconfiguring your accessory to its original form is a more complicated process that takes 1 minute. Each reconfigured item takes the normal number of hands to use and draws any usage from the all-purpose accessory&rsquo;s own battery.</p>",
