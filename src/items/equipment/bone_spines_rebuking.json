You can retract or harmlessly extend your spines as a standard action. You can't extend bone spines while wearing armor not fitted to you. If your bone spines are extended and an opponent within 5 feet hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal the listed piercing damage to that attacker. If your opponent's attack roll is a natural 20, the attacker also gains the bleeding condition equal to the item level of your spines. If you have natural weapons and those weapons are magical, the damage dealt by your bone spines is also magical.</p>",
