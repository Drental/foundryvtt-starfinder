You gain blindsense (vibration) and sense through (blindsense&mdash;vibration), both with ranges of 30 feet. However, you can only use these senses while in contact with a solid surface like the ground or a wall, and only then to sense creatures and objects that are in contact with other solid surfaces directly connected to your surface. For example, you could sense others walking on the ground nearby, even on the other side of a wall, but while floating in a raft, you would be unable to detect creatures walking on the nearby shore for lack of a solid connection between the two surfaces.</p>",
