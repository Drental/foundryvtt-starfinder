You must be standing on the ground when you activate the time-pit boots, and you can&rsquo;t activate them in zero-g. Upon activating the boots, a rift in the fabric of time opens beneath your feet and sucks you in. The rift closes immediately behind you, and you can&rsquo;t take any other creatures with you. You cease to exist for 1d4 rounds as you fall though time; you are undetectable and can&rsquo;t be affected by any creature. You can&rsquo;t take actions during this time, as it passes instantaneously for you. You&rsquo;re then expelled through a momentary rift that appears above the space you occupied when you activated the boots (or the nearest random open space, if your original space is now occupied). You&rsquo;re treated as having fallen 50 feet for every round you were gone, although if you can fly or otherwise mitigate the falling damage, you land uninjured.</p>\n<p>Time-pit boots can&rsquo;t be recharged normally. When worn by a creature under a haste effect countered by slow, or under a slow effect countered by haste, the boots latch onto the slight temporal displacement to begin recharging. They can&rsquo;t be used for 24 hours, but recover all their charges at the end of that period.</p>",
