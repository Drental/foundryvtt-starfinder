The user gains a +2 insight bonus (or increases their existing insight bonus by 1) to perform Medicine checks and Sense Motive checks on living creatures they can perceive with this blindsense, and they can expend one charge as a standard action to replicate the effects of detect affliction on one target in their blindsense&rsquo;s range.</p>\n<p>Advanced models also exist, granting blindsight (life) with a range of 20 feet rather than blindsense (life) with a range of 10 feet.</p>",
