      "value": "<p>This single-use device turns an explosive charge into a trap, triggering when it senses nearby motion. When arming a primary explosive charge while performing demolitions, you can install a proximity switch into the explosive charge instead of programming a detonator to activate the charge. As a standard action, you can arm a proximity switch with a 1-minute countdown. An armed switch observes its surroundings with blindsight (vibration), automatically attempting Perception checks (with a bonus equal to 8 &times; its mk) to detect anything moving within 5 feet. If the device detects movement from a Tiny or larger creature or object, it detonates its explosive charges and is destroyed in the process. A proximity switch can be disabled as if it were a trap, triggering if the Engineering check fails by 5 or more.</p>",
