When you succeed at your saving throw against a line effect or such an effect misses you, as a reaction you can spend 1 Resolve Point to redirect the line, altering its direction up to 90 degrees beginning with your space. After you activate the refraction shell, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.</p>",
