      "value": "<p>Your respiratory system manufactures nanites that specialize in conducting and channeling electrical energy. As a standard action, you can breathe these nanites into a 10-foot burst with a range of 20 feet. The nanites remain airborne and active in the area for 1 minute, though a moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the nanites in 4 rounds, and a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the nanites in 1 round. As a reaction when you or an ally makes an attack that deals electricity damage to a single target in the nanites&rsquo; area, you can activate the nanites to have the attack instead affect all creatures in the nanites&rsquo; area, resolved as though the attack had the explode weapon special property. Alternatively, you can activate the nanites as a reaction when an effect with the electricity descriptor includes the nanites in its area, adding the nanites&rsquo; area to the triggering effect&rsquo;s area of effect. Either use destroys these nanites.</p>\n<p>After you create a cloud of nanites with this augmentation, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 2 Resolve Points at any point to recharge it immediately.</p>",
