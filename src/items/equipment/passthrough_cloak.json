When you activate the passthrough cloak, anything that contacts one of the pads immediately exits from a corresponding pad on the cloak&rsquo;s far side without having traveled through your space. Creatures making attacks through your square don&rsquo;t count the space you occupy toward their range or reach. While the cloak is active, you benefit from a 20% miss chance as if you had concealment, but you can&rsquo;t use this concealment to hide. An attack that misses you due to this miss chance continues through your space and might affect a creature adjacent to you and opposite the direction of the incoming attack; the attacker rerolls the attack roll against the new target, and you don&rsquo;t provide cover for this attack. Effects that block dimensional travel prevent the passthrough cloak from functioning.</p>\n<p>A passthrough cloak can&rsquo;t be recharged normally. When placed in an extradimensional space for at least 24 hours, it recovers all its charges.</p>",
