A Drift gauntlet is a six-fingered glove of articulated adamantine plates with four knuckles on each finger, readily wearable on any hand-like appendage, regardless of handedness. When you put on a Drift gauntlet, your hand painlessly transforms to fit its interior, giving you six four-knuckled fingers until the next time you take an 8-hour rest, when your hand regains its normal configuration. A creature must put on a Drift gauntlet willingly; it simply doesn&rsquo;t fit over the hand of an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p>The Drift gauntlet can&rsquo;t enter the Drift; if you&rsquo;re on a starship that engages its Drift engine while you&rsquo;re wearing it, you and the gauntlet get left behind. Once per day, you can grasp a creature or object with the Drift gauntlet and force it into the Drift. A creature can avoid this fate with a successful Will save (DC = 20 + your key ability score modifier); otherwise, it&rsquo;s cast into the Drift and must find its own means of escape. An unattended object you grasp is automatically forced into the Drift as long as it fits within a 10-foot cube. If you use this ability on a starship&rsquo;s Drift engine while the engine is activating, the trip takes its minimal amount of time in the Drift (treat each d6 rolled for travel time as 1) as it&rsquo;s hurled through that plane&mdash;but you&rsquo;re still left behind.</p>",
